## 2026-09-12 — Cross-platform paths + save feedback + Linux/Chromebook support

The app now works identically on Windows, Linux, macOS and the ChromeOS Linux
container, and where data is saved can be changed without editing a file.

### Added — portable path resolution (`server/paths.py`)

- **Env-var overrides** (highest precedence): `GENESSIS_DATA_DIR`,
  `GENESSIS_CHAT_SAVE_PATH`, `GENESSIS_RAG_DB_PATH` override the stored
  settings; `~` and `$VAR` are expanded, so `~/genessis-data` works. Precedence
  chain: env var -> `app_settings.json` -> project-relative `data/`.
- **Cross-platform Windows-path guard**: stored absolute Windows paths
  (`E:\data\...`, `\\server\share`) are detected and, on any non-Windows OS,
  mapped to project-relative folders with a one-time warning (`E:\data\rag_store`
  -> `<project>/data/rag_store`). Pure helper with injectable OS hint so it is
  unit-testable for Linux/macOS semantics.
- `server/paths.py` docstring + `about()` gained a `sources` map telling which
  setting source resolved each key.

### Changed — save flow + startup visibility

- `server/server.py` `/api/settings` — on save, any `dataDir`/`chatSavePath`/
  `ragDbPath` that is a Windows absolute path is cleared to `""` and reported
  in the response as `{normalized: [...]}`, so a settings file copied between
  machines never carries machine-specific `E:\...` paths.
- `server/server.py` `lifespan()` — prints the resolved data / chat records /
  RAG folders at boot and flags which keys are env-overridden.
- `dashboard/js/config-page.js` — save now shows a prominent green **"Settings
  saved"** response window that also lists any path fields that were cleared
  because they held Windows paths (plus the restart hint). `dashboard/config.html`
  gained the `.save-response` styles.
- `dashboard/config/app_settings.json` — `dataDir`, `chatSavePath`,
  `ragDbPath` cleared to `""` (defaults / env vars now control storage).

### Changed — docs

- `README.md` — new "Running on Linux / macOS / ChromeOS (Chromebook)"
  quickstart and "Changing where data is saved" (Settings vs env vars vs
  defaults) sections; folder tree updated (`js/ui/` + removed `test/`); the
  deleted `docs/documentation_CREATING_AGENTS.md` link replaced; "Recent
  changes" points at the current entry.
- `docs/RESTRUCTURE_README.md` — `test/` and the deleted agent-authoring doc
  removed from the tree; portable-`paths.py` note added under "Launching".

### Verified

- Path unit tests (forged posix semantics): drive/UNC detection; mapping
  `E:\data\rag_store` -> `data/rag_store` and UNC -> relative; unchanged on
  Windows and for POSIX absolute paths; env override wins over stored settings;
  `$HOME`/`~` expansion; `about()["sources"]` populated.
- `/api/settings` returns `{settings, normalized}` and clears Windows paths.
- uvicorn boot with `GENESSIS_DATA_DIR` set to a temp folder: boot log shows
  data/records/rag all under the override and `dataDir overridden by
  GENESSIS_DATA_DIR`; `/api/rag/status` 200.

## 2026-09-12 — Frontend wiring for the interface system + title propagation

The Modular Interface / update system is now reachable from the browser.
New `server/server.py` endpoints power a Settings card, a header pill shows
module activity, and the about.json title/tagline is propagated to the
browser tab on every page.

### Added — `/api/interface/*` endpoints (`server/server.py`)

- `GET /api/interface/status` — live module catalog (per domain), external
  archive contents, trace-log tail (`data/interface_trace.log`, last 20
  lines), and baseline info: folder, `BASELINE_MANIFEST.json` metadata and a
  live **drift count** (SHA-256 diff vs `current-known-good-copy/`).
- `POST /api/interface/apply` — `reload_all()` the update modules, then
  regenerate `docs/APP_STRUCTURE.md` + `docs/APP_CODE_SNAPSHOT.md`.
- `POST /api/interface/snapshot` — publish the current tree as the new
  baseline (rebaseline via `RestoreManager.snapshot_baseline()`).
- `POST /api/interface/restore` — `{baseline?, apply?, dryRun?}`; **dry-run by
  default**. A real restore backs up overwritten files to
  `data/snapshots/pre_restore_backup/` before rolling back, then regenerates
  the docs.
- `POST /api/interface/run` — `{domain, module, function, args?, kwargs?}`
  through `InterfaceDispatcher.execute_action()`. Arbitrary code execution;
  **disabled by default** and gated server-side by `INTERFACE_RUN_ENABLED`.
  Flipped with:
- `POST /api/interface/toggle-run` — `{enabled}` arms/disarms `/run` for the
  current process (logged to `data/interface_trace.log`).
- `RestoreManager.diff(baseline)` — silent SHA-256 comparison returning
  `{baseline, shared, modified, skipped, untracked}`; `restore()` and the
  status endpoint share it (no more double file-map builds).
- `about/set_title.py apply --snapshot` now snapshots AFTER the docs
  regeneration (was reversed, so the baseline captured stale docs and
  `restore --dry-run` reported the two doc files as modified).

### Added — frontend (`dashboard/`)

- `js/api/api.js` — `getInterfaceStatus`, `applyInterface`,
  `snapshotInterface`, `restoreInterface`, `runInterface`, `setRunEnabled`.
- `js/ui/interface-manager.js` — the "Updates / Interface" card on the
  Settings page (below Models): module catalog, archive, baseline freshness +
  drift, trace-log tail, Apply / Snapshot / Restore (dry-run) / Restore
  (real) buttons, and an **opt-in "Enable module execution" gated** run-module
  panel (function name + JSON args/kwargs) mirroring `run_enabled` from the
  server.
- `js/ui/interface-indicator.js` — quiet "N updates" header pill (green dot,
  amber when the baseline drifts, "\u2022 on" when run is armed); hidden on
  servers without `/api/interface/*`; links to `config.html#interface-section`.
  Rendered on `index.html` and `config.html`.
- `config.html` — `#interface-section` mount + local card styles.
- Title propagation: `app.js#setPageTitle()` now sets `document.title`
  (`<title> – <subtitle>`); `config-page.js` boot fetches `/api/about` for the
  tab title; `chat.html` fetches `/api/about` and shows a small site chip
  (`#sc-site-title`) in its header plus the tab title.

### Verified

- `py_compile` clean on `server/server.py` and `interface/restore_manager.py`.
- TestClient: `/api/interface/status` 200 (catalog, drift); `/run` denied with
  403 while disabled; `toggle-run` on -> `secondary_engine_action(5)` == `50`
  (traced); bad function -> 500; `apply` reloaded `engine=2` + regenerated
  docs; `restore` dry-run reported the expected modified files. All six pages
  endpoints serve 200.

## 2026-09-12 — 02 implementation plan folded in; server startup wiring

Follow-up to the Modular Interface build, based on `docs/02_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
(dropped into `docs/`). The plan's missing pieces were folded into the existing
implementation instead of a verbatim overwrite, preserving the earlier choices
(`current-known-good-copy/` baseline, `--dry-run`, `snapshot` command, safer
exclusions). The plan's Linux path (`venv/bin/python`) is `venv\Scripts\python.exe`
on this Windows project.

### Added

- `interface/updates/engine/newfunction.py` — sample engine update module
  (`execute_new_logic()` / `secondary_engine_action()`), the 02-plan Step 6
  example. `hello_update.py` is kept alongside.
- `update_manager.discover_all_active_modules()` — alias for `reload_all()`
  (clear catalog, drop cached modules, re-import from disk).
- `update_manager.list_domain_modules(domain)` — sorted module names per domain.
- `interface_dispatcher.execute_action(domain, module, function, *args)` —
  resolve a module by name through the update manager and run it traced;
  raises `ModuleNotFoundError` for unknown modules.
- Trace logging now also goes through the `app_change_tracker` logger with a
  `FileHandler` on `data/interface_trace.log` (02-plan Step 3); stdout print
  kept.

### Changed — server startup (02-plan Step 7)

- `server/server.py` — `lifespan()` now builds `UpdateManager`, runs
  `discover_all_active_modules()`, builds `InterfaceDispatcher`, and exposes
  both on `app.state` (`app.state.update_manager`,
  `app.state.interface_dispatcher`). Discovery failures print a warning and
  leave the state `None` so a broken update module never blocks server boot.

## 2026-09-12 — Modular Interface & System Update Architecture

Introduced a pluggable update/restore layer so new features never touch core
modules again. Design reference: `docs/01_IDEA_AND_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### Added — `interface/` package

- `interface/update_manager.py` (`UpdateManager`) — dynamically discovers and
  imports every `.py` under `interface/updates/<domain>/` (`engine/`,
  `tools/`, `server/`), keeps live module objects in `active_modules_catalog`,
  and exposes `get_active_module(domain, module)` for direct native execution.
  `move_module_to_external_archive(domain, module)` relocates retired update
  modules to `data/interface_archive/<domain>/`.
- `interface/interface_dispatcher.py` (`InterfaceDispatcher`) —
  `trace_and_execute(fn, *args)` logs the caller file + line number
  (via `inspect`) before running a module function, to
  `data/interface_trace.log`.
- `interface/restore_manager.py` (`RestoreManager`) — SHA-256 baseline
  comparison (`current-known-good-copy/` by default, `test/` fallback),
  `snapshot_baseline()` to publish a complete working copy of the last good
  source, and `restore()` which backs up every overwritten file to
  `data/snapshots/pre_restore_backup/<timestamp>/` before rolling back and
  then regenerates the docs snapshots. Restore semantics: only files present
  in BOTH trees whose checksum differs are overwritten; baseline-only and
  live-only files are reported but left untouched. User data is excluded
  (`data/`, `venv/`, `.git/`, `__pycache__/`, `current-known-good-copy/`,
  `test/`, `dashboard/config/app_settings.json`, `about/about.json`,
  `*.bak`, `*.pyc`).
- `interface/updates/` — seeded with `engine/`, `tools/`, `server/` domains
  and one example module (`engine/hello_update.py`: `run_example()` /
  `double()`).

### Added — documentation snapshots

- `scripts/update_docs.py` — regenerates `docs/APP_STRUCTURE.md` (folder-tree
  snapshot) and `docs/APP_CODE_SNAPSHOT.md` (per-file source snapshot; never
  embeds itself). Runs automatically on `apply` and after `restore`.

### Changed — CLI

- `about/set_title.py` now dispatches `apply`, `snapshot` and `restore`:
  - `python about/set_title.py apply [--snapshot]` — reload all active update
    modules (+ publish the baseline when `--snapshot` is passed), then
    regenerate the docs snapshots.
  - `python about/set_title.py snapshot [folder]` — publish the current tree
    into `current-known-good-copy/` (the default restore baseline).
  - `python about/set_title.py restore [baseline] [--dry-run]` — compare the
    live tree against the baseline, back up + restore modified files, and
    regenerate the docs snapshots.
  - no args still edits about.json interactively / positionally.

### Verified

- `python -m py_compile` passes on every new/changed module.
- `apply` discovered + imported `engine/hello_update` and generated both docs
  snapshots.
- Option B access returned live module: `run_example()` and `double(21) == 42`.
- `trace_and_execute()` logged the caller (`file:line -> module.function`) to
  `data/interface_trace.log`.
- `move_module_to_external_archive()` moved the example to
  `data/interface_archive/engine/` and refreshed the catalog.
- A real restore: tampered `docs/APP_STRUCTURE.md` was detected (1 modified),
  backed up to `data/snapshots/pre_restore_backup/<timestamp>/`, rolled back
  from the baseline, and both docs snapshots were regenerated. A fresh
  baseline yields `modified: 0` on `restore --dry-run`.
- Exclusions confirmed: no `.git/`, `data/`, or `venv/` content leaks into the
  generated snapshots.

### Changed — other

- `current-known-good-copy/` added to `.gitignore` (generated baseline copy;
  `data/` was already ignored).

## 2026-09-12 — Agent Monitor removed; launch fixed; docs updated

The Agent Monitoring feature (live activity feed) was removed and the affected
backend modules were restored to their original, working versions. Chats are
fully functional again.

### Removed — Agent Monitor (frontend)

The monitor was a companion window that polled a live activity feed while an
agent worked. It is gone entirely:

- `dashboard/monitor.html` — deleted (the monitor page).
- `dashboard/js/monitor.js` — deleted (polling loop + rendering).
- `dashboard/js/api/api.js` — `getActivity()` / `clearActivity()` removed
  (they called `/api/activity` and `/api/activity/clear`).
- `dashboard/chat.html` — the "Monitor" header button and its click listener
  removed.
- `dashboard/js/app.js` — `openAgentMonitor()` and the `config.onObserve`
  wiring removed.
- `dashboard/config.html` + `dashboard/js/config-page.js` — the "Agent
  Monitor" settings section (`#monitor-section`, `renderMonitorSection()`)
  removed.
- `server/__pycache__/activity.cpython-314.pyc` — stale bytecode cleaned.

Note: `dashboard/js/classes/chat-window.js` still has a generic `onObserve`
extension hook, but nothing sets it, so it never triggers.

### Removed — Agent Monitor (backend)

- `server/activity.py` — deleted (the ActivityFeed singleton + `/api/activity`
  endpoints no longer exist, so the poller 404s are gone).

### Restored — backend modules rolled back to working originals

- `engine/core/agent.py` — restored from the original; the monitor-era
  sink/events/`_emit`/`_clip_args` and stdout-capturing `act()` are gone.
  `think()` / `act()` / `observe()` behave as before.
- `server/server.py` — restored from the original base and the legitimate
  pre-monitor endpoints re-added so the Settings page keeps working:
  - `GET /api/tools`
  - `GET /api/agents/{agent_id}/config`
  - `PUT /api/agents/{agent_id}/config`
  - `GET /api/about`

Pre-rollback copies are kept as recovery backups:
`server/server.py.infected.bak` and `engine/core/agent.py.infected.bak`.

### Fixed — launching `server.py` from any directory

`server/server.py` now bootstraps `sys.path` at the top: it inserts the
project root and drops its own folder from the path so this file can never
shadow the `server/` package. Previously `python server.py` failed with
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'engine'` (and the `server`/`server.py`
name collision made a simple path fix impossible).

Now all three of these work:
`python server.py` (from `server/`), `python server/server.py` (from the
project root), and `venv\Scripts\python -m uvicorn server.server:app` (root).

### Changed — documentation

- `README.md` — rewritten to match the current layout (`engine/`, `server/`,
  `tools/`, `memory/`, `dashboard/`, ...), with a module-by-module inventory,
  up-to-date API table and launch instructions.
- `docs/RESTRUCTURE_README.md` — folder tree refreshed, monitor removal and
  launch-anywhere noted.
